# Task 21: Event System Integration Tests

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Requirements**: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive integration tests for the centralized event system that verify cross-system communication, event ordering, realistic load scenarios, and performance with production-like listener counts.

## Implementation Summary

### New Test File Created

**File**: `Source/DelveDeep/Private/Tests/EventSystemIntegrationTests.cpp`  
**Lines of Code**: 1,007  
**Test Count**: 5 integration tests

### Test Coverage

#### 1. Combat to UI/Progression Integration Test
**Test**: `FDelveDeepEventCombatToUIProgressionIntegrationTest`

Tests event flow from combat system broadcasting damage/kill events to:
- UI system updating health bars and damage numbers
- Progression system awarding experience and triggering level ups

**Scenario Tested**:
- Player attacks enemy (damage event)
- Enemy health changes (health change event)
- Multiple attacks until enemy dies
- Kill event triggers experience award
- Second kill triggers level up

**Systems Verified**:
- Combat system tracks damage and kills
- UI system receives and displays damage/health updates
- Progression system awards XP and triggers level ups

#### 2. Cross-System Communication Test
**Test**: `FDelveDeepEventCrossSystemCommunicationTest`

Tests event flow between 4+ systems:
- Combat System (tracks all combat events)
- UI System (high priority, immediate updates)
- Progression System (normal priority, XP tracking)
- AI System (spatial filtering, threat detection)

**Scenario Tested**:
- Complex combat with multiple enemies
- Attack → Damage → Health Change → Kill event chains
- Spatial filtering for AI threat detection
- Hierarchical tag matching for combat events

**Verification**:
- All systems receive appropriate events
- No direct dependencies between systems
- Event filtering works correctly
- Statistics tracked accurately across systems

#### 3. Event Ordering Across Systems Test
**Test**: `FDelveDeepEventOrderingAcrossSystemsTest`

Tests that events are processed in correct priority order:
- High Priority: UI, Combat (execute first)
- Normal Priority: Progression, AI (execute second)
- Low Priority: Statistics (execute last)

**Verification**:
- Priority-based execution order maintained
- Consistent ordering across multiple events
- Within same priority, registration order preserved

#### 4. Realistic Load Scenario Test
**Test**: `FDelveDeepEventRealisticLoadScenarioTest`

Simulates realistic combat encounter:
- Player vs 5 enemies
- Each enemy takes 3 hits to kill
- 19 total listeners across all systems
- 50 total events generated (attacks, damage, health, kills)

**Systems Simulated**:
- UI System: 5 listeners (health bars, damage numbers, kill notifications)
- Combat System: 7 listeners (damage tracking, combo, effects, sound)
- Progression System: 2 listeners (XP tracking, achievements)
- AI System: 5 listeners (threat detection, behavior, coordination)

**Performance Verified**:
- Average time per event < 1ms
- All events processed correctly
- No dropped events or missed listeners

#### 5. Realistic Listener Counts Test
**Test**: `FDelveDeepEventRealisticListenerCountsTest`

Tests performance with production-like listener counts:
- Damage events: 10 listeners
- Health events: 6 listeners
- Attack events: 8 listeners
- Kill events: 5 listeners
- Experience events: 4 listeners
- Total: 33 listeners across 5 event types

**Test Methodology**:
- 100 events per type (500 total events)
- Measured broadcast time for each event
- Calculated min, max, and average times

**Performance Targets Met**:
- Average broadcast time < 1ms ✓
- Max broadcast time < 5ms ✓
- System overhead < 0.1ms per event ✓

## Test Fixture

```cpp
struct FCombatSystem
{
    int32 DamageEventsReceived;
    int32 AttackEventsReceived;
    int32 KillEventsReceived;
    float TotalDamageDealt;
    int32 TotalKills;
};

struct FUISystem
{
    int32 HealthChangeEventsReceived;
    int32 DamageEventsReceived;
    float LastHealthValue;
    float LastDamageAmount;
};

{
    int32 KillEventsReceived;
    int32 ExperienceGained;

};

struct FAISystem
{
    int32 AttackEventsReceived;
    int32 DamageEventsReceived;
