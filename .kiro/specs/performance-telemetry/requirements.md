# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Performance Telemetry System provides comprehensive performance monitoring infrastructure for DelveDeep, enabling developers to identify bottlenecks, optimize critical paths, and ensure the game meets its 60+ FPS target. This system implements Unreal Engine's stat groups, cycle counters, and custom performance tracking to provide real-time and historical performance data.

The telemetry system will serve as the foundation for performance optimization throughout development, providing actionable metrics for frame time, memory usage, system-specific overhead, and gameplay performance. It integrates with Unreal's profiling tools while adding game-specific metrics tailored to DelveDeep's architecture.

## Glossary

- **Telemetry System**: The centralized UGameInstanceSubsystem that manages performance metric collection, aggregation, and reporting

- **Performance Budget**: Target time allocation for specific systems (e.g., combat system: 2ms per frame)
- **Frame Time**: Total time to render one frame, target: <16.67ms for 60 FPS
- **Performance Spike**: Frame time exceeding budget by 50% or more
- **Performance Baseline**: Reference performance metrics captured under controlled conditions
- **Telemetry Sample**: Single performance measurement with timestamp and context
- **Performance Report**: Aggregated telemetry data over a time period with statistics
- **Budget Violation**: System exceeding its allocated performance budget
