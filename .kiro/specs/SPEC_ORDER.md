## Notes

- **Critical Priority**: Must be implemented for core functionality
- **High Priority**: Important for complete gameplay experience
- **Medium Priority**: Enhances gameplay but not essential for MVP
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features for post-launch or extended development

## Recommended Approach

1. Complete all Phase 1 specs before moving to Phase 2
2. Within each phase, implement specs in the listed order
3. Test thoroughly after each spec implementation
4. Update documentation as you complete each spec
5. Consider creating a minimal playable version after Phase 3
6. Iterate on balance and polish during Phases 6-7
7. Phase 8 features can be implemented as needed or post-launch

## Estimated Timeline

- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Phases 1-3 (6 weeks)
- **Feature Complete**: Phases 1-6 (12 weeks)
- **Content Complete**: Phases 1-7 (14 weeks)
- **Polish & Advanced Features**: Phase 8 (2+ weeks)

**Total Estimated Development Time**: 16+ weeks for full implementation
