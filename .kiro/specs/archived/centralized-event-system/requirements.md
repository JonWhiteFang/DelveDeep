# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Centralized Event System provides a gameplay event bus using GameplayTags for system-to-system communication without tight coupling. This system enables loose coupling between game systems by allowing them to communicate through events rather than direct references, improving maintainability, testability, and extensibility.

The event system will serve as the communication backbone for DelveDeep, allowing systems like combat, progression, AI, and UI to react to gameplay events without knowing about each other's implementation details.

## Glossary

- **Event System**: The centralized UGameInstanceSubsystem that manages event registration, broadcasting, and listener management
- **Event Listener**: A system or component that subscribes to specific gameplay events
- **Event Broadcaster**: A system or component that triggers gameplay events
- **GameplayTag**: Unreal Engine's hierarchical tag system used to categorize and identify events (e.g., "DelveDeep.Combat.Damage.Dealt")
- **Event Payload**: Data structure containing contextual information about an event (e.g., damage amount, attacker, victim)
- **Event Priority**: Execution order for event listeners (High, Normal, Low)
- **Event Filter**: Criteria for determining which events a listener should receive
- **Deferred Event**: Event that is queued and processed at a safe time rather than immediately

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a combat system developer, I want to broadcast damage events without knowing which systems need to react, so that I can maintain loose coupling between systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Combat System broadcasts a damage event, THE Event System SHALL deliver the event to all registered listeners for that event type
2. WHEN THE Combat System broadcasts a damage event, THE Event System SHALL include payload data containing attacker reference, victim reference, damage amount, and damage type
3. WHEN THE Combat System broadcasts a damage event, THE Event System SHALL complete event delivery within 1 millisecond for up to 50 listeners
4. WHEN THE Combat System broadcasts a damage event with no registered listeners, THE Event System SHALL complete the broadcast operation without errors or warnings
5. WHEN THE Combat System broadcasts a damage event, THE Event System SHALL support hierarchical event matching using GameplayTag parent-child relationships

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a progression system developer, I want to listen for player kill events without directly coupling to the combat system, so that I can award experience points independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Progression System registers a listener for player kill events, THE Event System SHALL invoke the listener callback when matching events are broadcast
2. WHEN THE Progression System registers a listener with High priority, THE Event System SHALL invoke that listener before Normal and Low priority listeners
3. WHEN THE Progression System unregisters a listener, THE Event System SHALL not invoke that listener for subsequent events
4. WHEN THE Progression System listener callback executes, THE Event System SHALL provide access to event payload data including killed enemy reference and experience value
5. IF THE Progression System listener callback throws an exception, THEN THE Event System SHALL log the error and continue processing remaining listeners

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a UI developer, I want to receive health change events to update the health bar, so that players see real-time feedback without the UI directly accessing character data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Character System broadcasts a health change event, THE Event System SHALL deliver the event to all UI listeners subscribed to health events
2. WHEN THE UI System registers a listener for health change events, THE Event System SHALL support filtering by specific actor instances
3. WHEN THE Character System broadcasts multiple health change events in a single frame, THE Event System SHALL deliver all events in the order they were broadcast
4. WHEN THE UI System receives a health change event, THE Event System SHALL provide payload data including previous health value, new health value, and character reference
5. WHEN THE UI System is destroyed, THE Event System SHALL automatically unregister all listeners associated with that system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to listen for player attack events to trigger enemy reactions, so that monsters can respond to player actions without polling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Combat System broadcasts a player attack event, THE Event System SHALL deliver the event to all AI listeners within 1 millisecond
2. WHEN THE AI System registers a listener with spatial filtering, THE Event System SHALL only deliver events occurring within the specified radius
3. WHEN THE AI System registers a listener for attack events, THE Event System SHALL support wildcard matching for all attack subtypes using GameplayTag hierarchy
4. WHEN THE AI System receives an attack event, THE Event System SHALL provide payload data including attack location, attack type, and attacker reference
5. WHEN THE AI System listener modifies game state, THE Event System SHALL support deferred event processing to avoid mid-frame state changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a statistics system developer, I want to track all gameplay events for analytics, so that I can generate comprehensive player statistics without modifying other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Statistics System registers a global listener, THE Event System SHALL deliver all broadcast events regardless of event type
2. WHEN THE Statistics System processes events, THE Event System SHALL provide event metadata including timestamp, event tag, and payload size
3. WHEN THE Event System broadcasts 1000 events per second, THE Event System SHALL maintain frame rate above 60 FPS with statistics tracking enabled
4. WHEN THE Statistics System queries event history, THE Event System SHALL provide access to the last 100 events with full payload data
5. WHEN THE Statistics System is disabled, THE Event System SHALL skip event delivery to that system without affecting other listeners

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a save system developer, I want to defer event processing during save operations, so that I can ensure data consistency without race conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Save System requests deferred event processing, THE Event System SHALL queue all broadcast events instead of delivering them immediately
2. WHEN THE Save System completes the save operation, THE Event System SHALL process all queued events in the order they were broadcast
3. WHEN THE Event System is in deferred mode, THE Event System SHALL limit the event queue to 1000 events to prevent memory overflow
4. IF THE Event System queue exceeds 1000 events, THEN THE Event System SHALL log a warning and discard the oldest events
5. WHEN THE Event System processes deferred events, THE Event System SHALL complete processing within 10 milliseconds for 1000 queued events

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer debugging event flow, I want to visualize event broadcasts and listeners, so that I can understand system interactions and diagnose issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Developer enables event logging, THE Event System SHALL log all broadcast events with event tag, payload summary, and listener count
2. WHEN THE Developer executes the list listeners console command, THE Event System SHALL display all registered listeners grouped by event tag
3. WHEN THE Developer enables event visualization, THE Event System SHALL display on-screen debug information showing recent events and active listeners
4. WHEN THE Developer executes the event statistics console command, THE Event System SHALL display metrics including total events broadcast, average listeners per event, and average processing time
5. WHEN THE Developer enables event tracing, THE Event System SHALL record event call stacks for debugging listener registration issues

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the event system to validate event payloads, so that I can catch data errors early and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Event System broadcasts an event with payload data, THE Event System SHALL validate that the payload matches the expected structure for that event type
2. WHEN THE Event System detects an invalid payload, THE Event System SHALL log an error with details about the validation failure
3. WHEN THE Event System validates event payloads, THE Event System SHALL use FValidationContext for consistent error reporting

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Event System processes events, THE Event System SHALL track cycle counter statistics for event broadcasting and listener invocation
2. WHEN THE Developer queries performance metrics, THE Event System SHALL report average time per event broadcast, average time per listener callback, and total event system overhead
3. WHEN THE Event System detects a listener callback exceeding 5 milliseconds, THE Event System SHALL log a performance warning with listener details
4. WHEN THE Event System broadcasts events, THE Event System SHALL maintain overhead below 0.1 milliseconds per event for events with fewer than 10 listeners
5. WHEN THE Event System is profiled, THE Event System SHALL provide stat group "DelveDeep.Events" with detailed performance breakdowns

### Requirement 10
