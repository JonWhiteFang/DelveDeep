# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automated Testing Framework provides comprehensive C++ unit testing infrastructure for DelveDeep, enabling developers to write, run, and maintain automated tests for all game systems. This framework enhances Unreal Engine's native Automation System with Google Test-style assertion macros and testing utilities to provide fast, reliable test execution with minimal friction.

The testing framework will serve as the foundation for quality assurance throughout development, catching regressions early and enabling confident refactoring. It leverages Unreal's proven Automation System while providing a familiar testing API for developers experienced with modern C++ testing frameworks. This approach avoids external dependencies while maintaining seamless integration with UE5's build system, editor, and CI/CD tools.
