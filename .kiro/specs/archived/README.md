# Archived Specs

This directory contains completed and archived specs from the DelveDeep project. Each archived spec represents a fully implemented system that serves as a reference for future development.

## Archived Specs

### Data-Driven Configuration System
**Archived:** October 23, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

High-performance configuration system using UDataAsset classes and UDataTable structures. Achieved all performance targets (<100ms init, <1ms queries, >95% cache hit rate) with comprehensive validation and hot-reload support.

**Key Features:**
- FValidationContext for error/warning tracking
- UDelveDeepConfigurationManager subsystem
- Data asset classes (Character, Weapon, Ability, Upgrade)
- Data table structures (Monster configuration)
- Console commands for debugging
- Full Blueprint integration

**Documentation:**

## Using Archived Specs

Archived specs serve as:
1. **Reference implementations** for similar systems
2. **Best practice examples** for architecture patterns
3. **Historical record** of design decisions
4. **Learning resources** for new team members

When implementing new systems, review relevant archived specs to follow established patterns and avoid repeating solved problems.
