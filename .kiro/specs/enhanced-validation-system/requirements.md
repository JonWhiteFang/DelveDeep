# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Validation System extends the existing FValidationContext infrastructure to provide advanced validation capabilities including severity levels, validation rule registration, automatic validation triggers, metrics tracking, and extensibility through custom validators. This system will serve as the foundation for robust error handling across all DelveDeep systems, enabling better debugging, automated quality assurance, and comprehensive diagnostics.

The current FValidationContext provides basic error/warning tracking with formatted reporting. The enhanced system will add severity levels (Critical, Error, Warning, Info), a validation rule registry, automatic validation on asset save (Editor integration), validation metrics tracking, and custom validation delegates for extensibility.

## Glossary

- **Validation System**: The comprehensive framework for validating data integrity, configuration correctness, and runtime state across all DelveDeep systems
- **FValidationContext**: The existing struct that tracks validation errors and warnings with system/operation context
- **Validation Rule**: A registered validation function that can be applied to specific data types or conditions
- **Severity Level**: The classification of validation issues (Critical, Error, Warning, Info) indicating their impact
- **Validation Metrics**: Statistical data tracking validation performance, error frequency, and common issues
- **Custom Validator**: User-defined validation logic that can be registered and executed by the validation system
- **Validation Delegate**: A callback mechanism allowing systems to respond to validation events
- **Asset Validator**: Editor-integrated validation that runs automatically when assets are saved or modified
- **Validation Rule Registry**: A centralized system for registering, managing, and executing validation rules
- **Validation Report**: A formatted output containing all validation issues, context, and metrics

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Severity Level System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation issues to be classified by severity (Critical, Error, Warning, Info), so that I can prioritize fixes and understand the impact of each issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a validation issue is added to FValidationContext, THE Validation System SHALL support four severity levels: Critical, Error, Warning, and Info
2. WHEN a Critical severity issue is added, THE Validation System SHALL log with Error severity and mark the validation as failed
3. WHEN an Error severity issue is added, THE Validation System SHALL log with Error severity and mark the validation as failed
4. WHEN a Warning severity issue is added, THE Validation System SHALL log with Warning severity but allow validation to pass
5. WHEN an Info severity issue is added, THE Validation System SHALL log with Display severity and allow validation to pass
6. WHEN generating a validation report, THE Validation System SHALL group issues by severity level with clear visual distinction
7. WHEN checking validation status, THE Validation System SHALL provide separate methods to check for Critical issues, Errors, Warnings, and Info messages

### Requirement 2: Validation Rule Registry

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register reusable validation rules that can be applied to multiple data types, so that I can maintain consistent validation logic across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Validation System SHALL provide a UDelveDeepValidationSubsystem that manages validation rule registration
2. WHEN a validation rule is registered, THE Validation System SHALL store the rule with a unique identifier and associated data type

4. WHEN a validation rule is executed, THE Validation System SHALL pass the target object and a FValidationContext to the rule function
5. THE Validation System SHALL support registering rules via C++ function pointers, lambda expressions, and Blueprint-callable delegates
6. WHEN multiple rules are registered for the same type, THE Validation System SHALL execute all applicable rules in registration order
7. THE Validation System SHALL provide methods to unregister rules, query registered rules, and clear all rules for a specific type

### Requirement 3: Automatic Asset Validation

4. WHEN asset validation produces Warnings or Info messages, THE Validation System SHALL allow the asset to be saved but display the messages in the Message Log
5. THE Validation System SHALL provide a console command to validate all assets in a specified directory
6. THE Validation System SHALL provide a console command to validate a single asset by path
7. WHERE validation is performed in the Editor, THE Validation System SHALL display validation results in the Output Log with clickable links to problematic assets

### Requirement 4: Validation Metrics Tracking

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Validation System SHALL track the total number of validations performed since initialization
2. THE Validation System SHALL track the number of validations that passed and failed
3. THE Validation System SHALL track the frequency of each unique error message

7. THE Validation System SHALL provide a console command to display current validation metrics
8. THE Validation System SHALL provide a console command to reset validation metrics
9. THE Validation System SHALL persist validation metrics to a JSON file for analysis between sessions

### Requirement 5: Custom Validation Delegates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register custom validation callbacks that execute when specific validation events occur, so that I can extend validation behavior without modifying core validation code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Validation System SHALL provide a delegate that fires before validation begins for any object
2. THE Validation System SHALL provide a delegate that fires after validation completes for any object
3. THE Validation System SHALL provide a delegate that fires when a Critical or Error severity issue is added
4. WHEN a validation delegate is registered, THE Validation System SHALL execute the delegate at the appropriate validation lifecycle point
5. WHEN a pre-validation delegate is executed, THE Validation System SHALL pass the object being validated and allow the delegate to modify validation behavior
6. WHEN a post-validation delegate is executed, THE Validation System SHALL pass the validation result and allow the delegate to perform cleanup or additional processing
7. THE Validation System SHALL support multiple delegates registered for the same validation event, executing them in registration order

### Requirement 6: Validation Context Enhancements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced validation context that includes source location, timestamps, and nested validation support, so that I can debug complex validation scenarios more effectively.
