# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Character System Foundation provides the core architecture for all playable characters in DelveDeep, supporting four distinct character classes (Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Necromancer) through a component-based design. This system establishes the base character actor, component architecture, and class-specific mechanics that enable unique playstyles while maintaining code reusability and extensibility.

The character system integrates with the existing Data-Driven Configuration System for character stats and abilities, the Centralized Event System for gameplay communication, and the Performance Telemetry System for monitoring. It follows Unreal Engine 5 best practices with component-based architecture, Blueprint-ready design, and performance optimization through tick management and object pooling.

## Glossary

- **Character System**: The complete architecture for playable characters including base actor, components, and class-specific mechanics
- **Base Character Actor**: ADelveDeepCharacter - the parent actor class for all playable characters
- **Character Component**: UDelveDeepCharacterComponent - base class for modular character functionality
- **Character Class**: One of four playable classes (Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Necromancer) with unique mechanics
- **Stats Component**: UDelveDeepStatsComponent - manages health, mana/energy, and derived stats
- **Resource System**: Class-specific resource management (Mana for Mage, Energy for Ranger, Rage for Warrior, Souls for Necromancer)
- **Character Data**: UDelveDeepCharacterData - data asset defining character stats and abilities
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Design pattern using composition over inheritance for modular functionality
- **Paper2D**: Unreal Engine's 2D sprite rendering system
- **Flipbook**: Animated sprite sequence in Paper2D
