# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data-Driven Configuration System provides a foundation for managing all game parameters, statistics, and configuration data through Unreal Engine's UDataAsset system. This system enables designers and developers to modify game balance, character stats, monster configurations, upgrade costs, and other gameplay parameters without requiring code changes or recompilation. The system must support Blueprint integration, runtime validation, and efficient data loading while maintaining type safety and clear organization.

## Glossary

- **Configuration System**: The complete data-driven configuration infrastructure for DelveDeep
- **Data Asset**: An Unreal Engine UDataAsset-derived class that stores configuration data
- **Data Table**: An Unreal Engine UDataTable that stores rows of structured data
- **Character Data**: Configuration parameters for player character classes (Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Necromancer)
- **Monster Data**: Configuration parameters for enemy monsters and AI behavior
- **Upgrade Data**: Configuration parameters for progression system upgrades and costs
- **Weapon Data**: Configuration parameters for weapons and combat items
- **Ability Data**: Configuration parameters for character abilities and skills
- **Validation Context**: A structure that tracks validation errors and warnings during data loading
- **Blueprint Integration**: Exposure of C++ classes and data to Unreal Engine's Blueprint visual scripting system
- **Runtime Loading**: The process of loading and accessing data assets during game execution
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time and runtime checks ensuring data types are used correctly

4. THE Configuration System SHALL expose all character data properties to Blueprint with BlueprintReadOnly access.

5. WHEN character data is accessed at runtime, THE Configuration System SHALL return valid data within 1 millisecond per query.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to configure monster stats and behavior through data tables, so that I can create diverse enemy types efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a FDelveDeepMonsterConfig structure that stores monster health, damage, move speed, detection range, attack range, and AI behavior type.

3. THE Configuration System SHALL support at least 50 unique monster configurations in a single data table without performance degradation.

4. WHEN a monster configuration is queried by name, THE Configuration System SHALL return the configuration data within 0.5 milliseconds.

5. THE Configuration System SHALL validate that all monster configurations have positive health values and non-negative damage values during data table loading.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to define upgrade costs and effects in data assets, so that I can balance the progression system without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a UDelveDeepUpgradeData class that stores upgrade name, description, base cost, cost scaling factor, and stat modifications.

2. THE Configuration System SHALL support upgrade data assets that reference other upgrade data assets to create upgrade trees and dependencies.

3. WHEN an upgrade data asset is loaded, THE Configuration System SHALL validate that cost scaling factors are between 1.0 and 10.0.

4. THE Configuration System SHALL expose upgrade data to Blueprint with BlueprintReadOnly access for UI display.

5. WHEN calculating dynamic upgrade costs, THE Configuration System SHALL use the formula: FinalCost = BaseCost * (ScalingFactor ^ UpgradeLevel).

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to configure weapon and ability parameters through data assets, so that I can create diverse combat options for each character class.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a UDelveDeepWeaponData class that stores weapon damage, attack speed, range, projectile speed, and damage type.

2. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a UDelveDeepAbilityData class that stores ability cooldown, resource cost, damage multiplier, area of effect radius, and duration.

3. WHEN weapon or ability data is modified, THE Configuration System SHALL validate that cooldown values are greater than 0.1 seconds and resource costs are non-negative.

4. THE Configuration System SHALL support weapon data assets that reference ability data assets for special weapon abilities.

5. THE Configuration System SHALL expose all weapon and ability properties to Blueprint with BlueprintReadOnly access.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation of all configuration data, so that I can detect errors early and prevent runtime crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data asset is loaded, THE Configuration System SHALL validate all numeric properties are within defined ranges.

2. IF a data asset fails validation, THEN THE Configuration System SHALL log a detailed error message including the asset name, property name, invalid value, and expected range.

3. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a console command "DelveDeep.ValidateAllData" that validates all loaded configuration data and reports results.

4. WHEN validation detects missing asset references, THE Configuration System SHALL log a warning and use default fallback values.

5. THE Configuration System SHALL complete validation of all configuration data within 100 milliseconds during game initialization.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized configuration manager, so that I can access all game configuration data through a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a UDelveDeepConfigurationManager class that inherits from UGameInstanceSubsystem.

2. THE Configuration System SHALL initialize the configuration manager during game instance initialization before any gameplay systems start.

3. WHEN any system requests configuration data, THE Configuration System SHALL provide access through the configuration manager singleton.

4. THE Configuration System SHALL cache all loaded data assets to prevent redundant disk reads.

5. THE Configuration System SHALL provide Blueprint-callable functions for accessing character data, monster data, upgrade data, weapon data, and ability data by name or identifier.

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data assets to support hot-reloading in development builds, so that I can test configuration changes without restarting the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development builds, THE Configuration System SHALL detect when data assets are modified on disk.

2. WHEN a data asset is modified, THE Configuration System SHALL reload the asset and update all cached references within 2 seconds.

3. THE Configuration System SHALL broadcast a notification event when data assets are hot-reloaded.

4. WHEN hot-reloading occurs, THE Configuration System SHALL re-validate all reloaded data assets.

5. THE Configuration System SHALL disable hot-reloading in shipping builds to prevent performance overhead.

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear organization of data assets, so that I can easily locate and manage configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration System SHALL define a standard directory structure: Content/Data/Characters/, Content/Data/Monsters/, Content/Data/Upgrades/, Content/Data/Weapons/, Content/Data/Abilities/.

2. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a naming convention for data assets: DA_[Category]_[Name] (e.g., DA_Character_Warrior, DA_Monster_Goblin).

3. THE Configuration System SHALL provide a naming convention for data tables: DT_[Category]_[Name] (e.g., DT_Monster_Configs, DT_Upgrade_Costs).

4. THE Configuration System SHALL log a warning when data assets are found outside the standard directory structure.

5. THE Configuration System SHALL provide documentation that describes the directory structure and naming conventions.

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe access to configuration data, so that I can prevent runtime type errors and crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration System SHALL use strongly-typed C++ classes for all data assets (no generic key-value storage).

2. THE Configuration System SHALL use Unreal Engine's UPROPERTY system with appropriate metadata specifiers (EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category).

3. WHEN accessing configuration data, THE Configuration System SHALL return const references to prevent accidental modification.

4. THE Configuration System SHALL provide template functions for type-safe data asset retrieval by class type.

5. IF a requested data asset type does not match the loaded asset type, THEN THE Configuration System SHALL log an error and return nullptr.

### Requirement 10
