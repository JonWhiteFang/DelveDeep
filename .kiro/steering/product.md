# DelveDeep Product Overview

DelveDeep is a top-down 2D action RPG built in Unreal Engine 5.6. Players control one of four distinct character classes (Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Necromancer) as they venture into procedurally-generated underground mines, fighting intelligent monsters, collecting coins, and upgrading their abilities.

## Core Features

- **Four Character Classes**: Each with unique combat mechanics, resource systems, and playstyles
- **Roguelike Gameplay**: Procedurally-generated mines with depth-based difficulty progression
- **Automatic Combat**: Streamlined combat with automatic targeting while maintaining strategic depth
- **Progression System**: Dynamic upgrades, skill trees, and meta-progression between runs
- **2D Sprite-Based Graphics**: Paper2D rendering with atmospheric effects and parallax backgrounds

## Development Environment

**CRITICAL**: This is a code-only development environment with NO Unreal Engine 5 Editor access. All work must be pure C++ implementation with Blueprint-ready design. Never suggest opening `.uproject` files, creating Blueprint assets, or any UE5 Editor operations.

## Target Performance

- 60+ FPS gameplay
- Sub-100ms save/load times
- Sub-millisecond configuration data queries
