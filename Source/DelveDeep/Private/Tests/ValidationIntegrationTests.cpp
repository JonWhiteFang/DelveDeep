/**
 * Integration test documentation:
 * 
 * These tests verify the integration between the validation subsystem and other DelveDeep systems.
 * They require a full game instance to be available, so they are documented here but would need
 * to be implemented as functional tests or PIE tests in a full Unreal Engine environment.
 * 
 * Test Categories:
 * 1. Configuration Manager Integration
 * 2. Data Asset Validation
 * 3. Hot-Reload Integration
 * 4. Performance Validation

// Placeholder for integration test documentation

/*
 * Test: Configuration Manager Initialization with Validation Subsystem
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that the configuration manager properly integrates with the validation subsystem
 * during initialization.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create a game instance
 * 2. Initialize the validation subsystem
 * 3. Initialize the configuration manager
 * 4. Verify that validation rules are registered
 * 5. Verify that all loaded data is validated
 * 6. Check validation metrics
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Configuration manager should register 5 validation rules (Character, Monster, Upgrade, Weapon, Ability)
 * - All loaded data assets should be validated
 * - Validation metrics should show correct counts
 * - Cache should be populated with validation results
 */

/*
 * Test: Data Asset PostLoad Validation with Caching
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that data assets use the validation subsystem with caching in PostLoad().
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create a game instance with validation subsystem
 * 2. Load a character data asset
 * 3. Verify that PostLoad() triggers validation
 * 4. Verify that validation result is cached
 * 5. Load the same asset again
 * 6. Verify that cached result is used (cache hit)
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - First load should trigger validation and cache the result
 * - Second load should use cached result (no re-validation)
 * - Cache hit rate should increase
 * - Validation metrics should show correct counts
 */

/*
 * Test: Hot-Reload with Validation Cache Invalidation
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that hot-reload properly invalidates validation cache.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Load a data asset and validate it (cached)
 * 2. Simulate asset modification (hot-reload)
 * 3. Verify that cache is invalidated
 * 4. Verify that asset is re-validated
 * 5. Verify that new validation result is cached
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Hot-reload should invalidate cache for modified asset
 * - Asset should be re-validated after hot-reload
 * - New validation result should be cached
 * - Validation metrics should reflect re-validation
 */

/*
 * Test: Validation Performance with Large Dataset
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that validation meets performance targets with large datasets.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create 100+ test data assets
 * 2. Validate all assets using batch validation
 * 3. Measure total validation time
 * 4. Measure average validation time per asset
 * 5. Verify cache hit rate on second validation pass
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Total validation time should be <200ms for 100 assets
 * - Average validation time should be <1ms per asset
 * - Cache hit rate should be >90% on second pass
 * - Parallel validation should show performance improvement
 */

/*
 * Test: Validation Delegates Integration
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that validation delegates fire correctly during configuration manager validation.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Register pre-validation delegate
 * 2. Register post-validation delegate
 * 3. Register critical issue delegate
 * 4. Trigger validation through configuration manager
 * 5. Verify that delegates fire in correct order
 * 6. Verify that delegate parameters are correct
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Pre-validation delegate should fire before validation
 * - Post-validation delegate should fire after validation
 * - Critical issue delegate should fire for critical/error issues
 * - Delegates should receive correct object and context parameters
 */

/*
 * Test: Validation Rule Priority Ordering
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that validation rules execute in priority order.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Register multiple validation rules with different priorities
 * 2. Validate an object
 * 3. Track execution order
 * 4. Verify that higher priority rules execute first
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Rules should execute in descending priority order
 * - Rules with same priority should execute in registration order
 * - All rules should execute even if earlier rules fail
 */

/*
 * Test: Validation Metrics Persistence
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that validation metrics are persisted and loaded correctly.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Perform several validations to generate metrics
 * 2. Save metrics to file
 * 3. Reset metrics
 * 4. Load metrics from file
 * 5. Verify that loaded metrics match saved metrics
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Metrics should be saved to JSON file
 * - Loaded metrics should match saved metrics
 * - Metrics should include all tracked data (counts, times, frequencies)
 */

/*
 * Test: Backward Compatibility with Basic Validation
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that enhanced validation maintains backward compatibility.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create validation context using legacy methods (AddError, AddWarning)
 * 2. Verify that legacy arrays are populated
 * 3. Verify that new Issues array is also populated
 * 4. Verify that IsValid() works correctly
 * 5. Verify that GetReport() includes all issues
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Legacy ValidationErrors and ValidationWarnings arrays should be populated
 * - New Issues array should contain same information with severity
 * - IsValid() should return false for errors
 * - GetReport() should include all issues from both legacy and new arrays
