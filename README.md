# DelveDeep

A production-ready top-down 2D action RPG built in Unreal Engine 5.6 with modern C++ architecture.

## Overview

DelveDeep is a roguelike action RPG where players control one of four distinct character classes (Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Necromancer) as they venture into procedurally-generated underground mines, fighting intelligent monsters, collecting coins, and upgrading their abilities. The game emphasizes streamlined gameplay with automatic combat systems while maintaining strategic depth.

## Features

- **Roguelike Gameplay**: Procedurally-generated mines with depth-based difficulty progression
- **Automatic Combat**: Streamlined combat with automatic targeting while maintaining strategic depth
- **Progression System**: Dynamic upgrades, skill trees, and meta-progression between runs
- **2D Sprite-Based Graphics**: Paper2D rendering with atmospheric effects and parallax backgrounds
- **Data-Driven Configuration**: Comprehensive validation system for game balance and configuration

## Technical Stack

- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.6
- **Language**: Modern C++ (C++20)
- **Rendering**: Paper2D for 2D sprite-based graphics
- **Input**: Enhanced Input System (UE5 standard)
- **AI**: Behavior Trees with AI Perception
- **Target Performance**: 60+ FPS

## Development Environment

**Important**: This is a code-only development environment with NO Unreal Engine 5 Editor access. All work is pure C++ implementation with Blueprint-ready design for future UE5 Editor integration.

### Prerequisites

- Unreal Engine 5.6
- Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) or Xcode (macOS)
- C++20 compatible compiler

### Building the Project

```bash
# Generate project files
UnrealBuildTool -projectfiles

# Build the project
UnrealBuildTool DelveDeep Development Win64
```

## Implemented Systems

### Data-Driven Configuration System ✓

Comprehensive data-driven configuration system with validation, caching, and hot-reload support:

**Core Features**:
- **FValidationContext**: Tracks errors and warnings with detailed context
- **Configuration Manager**: Centralized subsystem for data asset access with sub-millisecond queries
- **Data Asset Classes**: Character, Weapon, Ability, Upgrade, and Monster configuration
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-100ms initialization, <1ms queries, >95% cache hit rate
- **Hot-Reload Support**: Development-time asset reloading within 2 seconds
- **Blueprint Ready**: All classes fully exposed to Blueprint

**Console Commands**:
```
DelveDeep.ValidateAllData         # Validate all configuration data
DelveDeep.ShowConfigStats         # Display performance statistics
DelveDeep.ListLoadedAssets        # List all cached assets
DelveDeep.ReloadConfigData        # Force reload all data
DelveDeep.DumpConfigData [Name]   # Dump asset properties
DelveDeep.CreateExampleData       # Create example test data
```

## Character Classes

### Warrior
- **Role**: Melee tank with area damage
- **Combat Style**: Close-quarters with cleave attacks
- **Resource**: Rage (builds with attacks and damage taken)

### Ranger
- **Role**: Ranged DPS specialist
- **Combat Style**: Projectile-based attacks with piercing
- **Resource**: Focus (regenerates over time)

### Mage
- **Role**: Elemental caster with area effects
- **Combat Style**: Spell-casting with mana management
- **Resource**: Mana (regenerates slowly)

### Necromancer
- **Role**: Summoner with minion control
- **Combat Style**: Minion-based combat with life manipulation
- **Resource**: Soul Energy (gained from kills)

## Code Standards

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: `A` (Actors), `U` (Objects/Components), `F` (Structs), `E` (Enums), `I` (Interfaces)
- **API Exposure**: Use `DELVEDEEP_API` for all public classes
- **File Naming**: `DelveDeepClassName.h/.cpp`

### Examples

```cpp
ADelveDeepPlayerCharacter    // Actor
UDelveDeepCombatComponent    // Component
FDelveDeepPlayerStats        // Struct
EDelveDeepCharacterClass     // Enum
IDelveDeepInteractable       // Interface
```

### Blueprint Integration

All C++ classes must be Blueprint-ready:

```cpp
UCLASS(BlueprintType, Blueprintable, Category = "DelveDeep")
class DELVEDEEP_API ADelveDeepActor : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "DelveDeep")
    void PerformAction();

    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadWrite, EditAnywhere, Category = "DelveDeep")
    float ActionValue = 100.0f;
};
```

### Performance Requirements

- Always disable ticking unless needed: `PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = false`
- Use tick intervals for non-critical updates: `PrimaryActorTick.TickInterval = 0.2f`
- Pre-allocate containers when size is known: `Items.Reserve(ExpectedMaxSize)`
- Use object pooling for frequently spawned objects

## Testing

### Running Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe DelveDeep -ExecCmds="Automation RunTests DelveDeep" -unattended

# Run specific test suite
UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe DelveDeep -ExecCmds="Automation RunTests DelveDeep.Validation" -unattended
```

### Console Commands

```bash
# System Testing
DelveDeep.ValidateAllSystems          # Run comprehensive system validation
DelveDeep.TestValidationSystem        # Test validation infrastructure

# Performance Monitoring
stat fps                              # Display frame rate
stat memory                           # Monitor memory usage
stat DelveDeep                        # Show DelveDeep-specific metrics

# Debug Visualization
DelveDeep.ToggleDebugHUD              # Show/hide debug overlay
```
